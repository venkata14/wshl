Description from MALTA Webpage:

# What is MALTA Clinic?
**Our mission: To provide exceptional and compassionate dental, medical, and eye care free of charge and without discrimination to  uninsured residents of metro Detroit.  **

The Order of Malta is a Catholic lay religious order dedicated to serving the poor and sick. In 2004, members of the Michigan Area Order of Malta were serving a meal in the basement Soup Kitchen of St. Leo’s Church in Detroit. Bishop Thomas Gumbleton, then pastor of St. Leo’s, asked the members to help guests of the soup kitchen who needed medical care. The Order of Malta accepted the challenge, founding the Malta Dental and Medical Clinic.

Our Clinic has served over 20,000 uninsured, low-income patients since its opening. For every dollar spent, the Clinic provides almost three times that amount in services, making our volunteer-driven model a tremendous value.

The Clinic accepts no fees for its services. The Clinic depends on the generosity of private donors like you.

The Clinic could not function without its volunteers: Dentists, doctors, and other highly qualified health professionals who give generously of their time and talent. In addition, student volunteers from the University of Detroit Mercy’s Dental School, Wayne County Community College hygiene program, Wayne State University School of Medicine, and Wayne State University Pharmacy School gain valuable experience while serving at the Clinic. 

After many years of providing care at St. Leo's, in June 2021 the Clinic formally opened in a new, more accessible location at 8642 Woodward in Detroit, sharing the building with the Center for the Works of Mercy, a ministry of Catholic Social Services of Southeast Michigan. With new, state-of-the-art equipment, the Clinic is poised to expand its services and reach more of those in need.
