# What is BCCCP?

“The Tri-County Breast and Cervical Cancer Control Program (BCCCP) is a community-based partnership created to help provide uninsured or under-insured individuals who face high out of pocket costs due to insurance deductibles full access to breast and cervical cancer screenings. We are one of the 11 regional programs authorized by the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) to accomplish this goal. Since 1992 the Tri-County BCCCP has provided over 120,000 free breast and cervical cancer screenings to local women. In addition to screening services we also provide needed follow up and help arrange treatment through our network of over 40 participating clinics and hospitals.” (Source: BCCCP Webpage)
