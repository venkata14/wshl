Description from HUDA Webpage:

# What is HUDA Clinic?
We provide FREE Primary Care, Dental Care, Mental Health Services, Vision Care, and Specialty Care for those who are uninsured and underinsured. HUDA Clinic is a health facility that offers free healthcare services to the public, which means no copays or fees. We provide preventative screenings, health assessments, management for chronic care illnesses, and referrals to specialists as needed. We have expanded from our humble beginnings in the Muslim Community Center in 2004 through the help of dedicated volunteers, partnerships with local organizations and hospitals, and generous donations.

The HUDA Clinic achieves its goals through generous donations, physician volunteerism, and passionate student leadership. We are also well-connected in the community through partnerships with homeless shelters, non-profit organizations, religious groups, and the universities training Michigan's future health professionals. Nestled in a community in Northwest Detroit is a small health facility called the Health Unit on Davison Avenue (HUDA Clinic), named after our original location. We have expanded to our new location at 13240 Woodrow Wilson St. Detroit, MI 48238.
